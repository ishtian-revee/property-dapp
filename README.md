This repository contains all the source code of a property decentralized application built on `Ethereum Blockchain (Goerli Test Network)`. This is a property marketplace where user can mint their property information as an `NFT` and can trade these NFTs to others. So, basically, anyone can buy properties in a form of NFTs. Also, the users need to trade their properties with `a custom ERC20 standard token called AWT (Awesome Token)` instead of native Ethereum currency (ETH).
